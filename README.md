This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
- npm install <br>
- npm run dev

## Highlights
Learned NextJS best practices 
- e.g. abstracting code that needs to use hooks (useState, useEffects etc.) into sub-components that use 'use client' in order to keep as many server component files as possible (makes app faster)
