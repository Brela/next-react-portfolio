### My New Portfolio, Built with NextJS

## Getting Started
- npm install <br>
- npm run dev

## Highlights
Learned NextJS best practices 
- e.g. abstracting code that needs to use hooks (useState, useEffects etc.) into sub-components that use 'use client' in order to keep as many server component files as possible (makes app faster)
