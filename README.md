## Highlights
Learned NextJS best practices 
 - abstract code that needs to use hooks (useState, useEffects etc.) into sub-components that use 'use client' in order to keep as many server component files as possible (makes app faster)
 - use built in Next features like the Image element

Made very simple and modern looking UI
